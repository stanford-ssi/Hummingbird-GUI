Valves that need to be actuated:
PTs(1-10): pressure readings 
Power valves(4): on and off 
Thermocouples(6): temperature readings
Load Cells(3): force readings
Motorized ball valve: in between 

also put expected values and have the interface raise warnings or errors if something is unusual 
green, yellow, red for different values 

graphs? or just numbers readings 

percent change > threshold: boldface 


pi controls the on and off or the switching, and you remotely control these from tcp
40 GPIOS on pi to control the actuators

#serial to get data 

#then use python to make the gui interface
